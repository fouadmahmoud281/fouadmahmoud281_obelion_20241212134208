Based on the information provided, I have extracted the following business requirements for the web application:

1. The web application should be a to-do list application.
2. The primary user of the app will be the client (single user).
3. The app should be simple and intuitive for the user to interact with.
4. The app should allow the user to create, edit, and delete tasks on their to-do list.
5. The user should be able to mark tasks as completed.
6. The app should have a clean and user-friendly interface.
7. The app should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
8. The user's data should be securely stored and protected.

These requirements align with the client's request for a to-do list application that is simple to use and catered to a single user.

Based on the user's responses, we can derive the following technical requirements for the web application:

1. **System Architecture**:
   - The web application should be designed to be responsive and work seamlessly on desktop devices.
   - The architecture should support individual user accounts to store and manage task data separately.

2. **Key Functionalities**:
   - The app should have a task management feature that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
   - User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure data security and privacy.
   - The app should provide a user-friendly interface for easy task management.

3. **System Behavior**:
   - The app should dynamically adjust its layout and functionality based on the device used (desktop).
   - Tasks added or modified by the user should be instantly reflected in the user interface without the need for manual refresh.

4. **Performance-Related Aspects**:
   - Security measures such as encryption should be implemented to protect user data.
   - The application should be scalable to accommodate potential future feature enhancements or increased user traffic.
   - Usability should be a key focus, with intuitive design and smooth navigation.

These technical requirements aim to ensure that the web application meets the user's needs for a simple and secure to-do list application that can be accessed on desktop devices. The requirements also address important aspects such as data security, scalability, and usability to deliver a high-quality user experience.
